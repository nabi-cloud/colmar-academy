## Project Overview

The landing page will provide essential information about the school's mission, programs, and facilities. The website will be accessible and visually appealing across various devices and screen sizes.

## Project Requirements

**Git Workflow:** Organize the project's development workflow using Git version control. Git commands used:

- `git init`: Initializing a Git repository in the project directory.
- `git add`: Add the files to commit to the staging area.
- `git commit -m`: Create a commit with a descriptive message.
- `git push`: Push commits to the remote repository.
- `git log`: See the commit history to track changes.

## Reflections

During the development of this project, there were circumstances that made me unable to finish this project in one sitting or even a week. When this happens in my past projects, I often forget where I left off and find myself spending minutes or hours on what to accomplish next. Thankfully, the Git control version enabled me to view a chronological record of commits I made, making it easy to track the progress and evolution of the website over time.

I used to manually go to GitHub and edit the code directly and push changes I made. Although it works, using Git commands made it so much easier to push changes to the remote repository from my own IDE. Plus, it also gives room for future collaborations with other contributors as well. Git is certainly part of modern web development practices and has a major positive impact on project outcomes.
